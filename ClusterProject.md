# Cluster Project

I will add more to this later, but the basic goals are as follows:

Basic Goals (70% unless diffculties arrise)

* Diagnose failed hardware issues on the cluster
* Install replacement hardware or use existing hardware to create functional nodes
* Get correct MPI for Greg Watkin's simulation software installed running

Devops/Advanced Goals (30%)

* Get packages, nodes, MPI, etc to deploy via an orchestration framework (puppet, chef, ansible)
* Install monitoring software (prometheus, nagios, elasticsearch)

This project will be done as a group with me, failure to participate or actively engage in learning the skills/technologies as we go along will result in loss of points.
